# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Model Publishing workflow automates the process of exposing deployed inference models for external consumption. This feature bridges the gap between model deployment (creating InferenceService resources) and external access by implementing tenant-based access control, API key generation, and appropriate gateway routing configurations. The system will automatically configure either HTTPRoute for traditional inference services or AIGatewayRoute for OpenAI-compatible models, including rate limiting and token bucket configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to publish deployed models for external access through the existing management service, so that tenants can consume inference services through secure API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates model publishing via existing management service API or UI THEN the system SHALL validate that the target InferenceService exists and is ready
2. WHEN publishing a model through existing management service THEN the system SHALL orchestrate tenant-specific access mappings with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN publishing a model via existing management service THEN the system SHALL generate unique API access keys for authentication
4. IF the model supports traditional inference THEN the existing management service SHALL create HTTPRoute configurations for Envoy Gateway
5. IF the model supports OpenAI schema THEN the existing management service SHALL create AIGatewayRoute configurations with OpenAI compatibility
6. WHEN creating gateway routes THEN the existing management service SHALL apply tenant-specific routing rules and path mappings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want to access published models through secure API endpoints, so that I can integrate inference capabilities into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is published for my tenant THEN I SHALL receive API access credentials and endpoint information
2. WHEN making inference requests THEN the system SHALL authenticate using API keys
3. WHEN accessing published models THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant isolation and access controls
4. WHEN using OpenAI-compatible models THEN the system SHALL support standard OpenAI API schemas and endpoints
5. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL apply rate limiting based on tenant quotas and model configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure rate limiting and quotas for published models, so that I can ensure fair resource usage and prevent abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN publishing OpenAI-compatible models THEN the system SHALL configure token bucket rate limiting
2. WHEN setting up rate limiting THEN the system SHALL support configurable requests per minute/hour limits
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP 429 responses
4. WHEN configuring quotas THEN the system SHALL support tenant-specific and model-specific limits
5. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL track API key usage and rate limit violations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage the lifecycle of published models through the existing management service, so that I can update access controls, rotate keys, and unpublish models when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing published models via existing management service API or UI THEN the system SHALL provide capabilities to list all published models by tenant
2. WHEN updating access controls through existing management service THEN the system SHALL support modifying tenant permissions without service interruption
3. WHEN rotating API keys via existing management service THEN the system SHALL generate new keys while maintaining backward compatibility during transition
4. WHEN unpublishing models through existing management service THEN the system SHALL remove gateway routes and revoke API access cleanly
5. WHEN models are updated or redeployed THEN the existing management service SHALL maintain published endpoints and configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples for accessing published models, so that I can quickly integrate inference capabilities into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is published THEN the system SHALL generate API documentation with endpoint URLs and authentication details
2. WHEN providing documentation THEN the system SHALL include code examples for common programming languages
3. WHEN models support OpenAI schema THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAI-compatible client examples
4. WHEN accessing traditional inference models THEN the system SHALL provide HTTP request examples with proper headers
5. WHEN rate limiting is configured THEN the system SHALL document quota limits and error handling approaches

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to monitor and audit published model access, so that I can track usage patterns and ensure security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are accessed THEN the system SHALL log all API requests with tenant, user, and model information
2. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on request volume, latency, and error rates per published model
3. WHEN tracking security events THEN the system SHALL log authentication failures, rate limit violations, and unauthorized access attempts
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support usage analytics by tenant, model, and time period
5. WHEN integrating with observability THEN the system SHALL expose metrics compatible with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
